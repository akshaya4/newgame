1.	Have all materials on hand. It can be very distracting to have to look for a pencil or a calculator in the middle of studying.
2.	try to understand the importance and benefit of every subject that you are studying and only then start your studies. If you study with sincerity and interest, you will be able to understand the subject better.
7.	Assess yourself what goes best for you- to read repeatedly, to read and then tell to mentor or to read loudly and write main points.
8.	Look over your notes everyday to make sure you've got it. Underline or highlight the bits of information that you know are most important. Interacting with your notes will help you remember them. 
9.	Avoid monotony by changing your study pattern regularly. After reading for a while, do some writing; thereafter again do some reading or learn something by heart if you have to (like poems). Again, shift to reading, then writing and so on. In this way, keep on changing the pattern of study.
3.	For a normal student, it is difficult to concentrate on any subject for more than 45 minutes. Hence, it is better to rest for a while in-between. During that time, you can devote 5 minutes for rest or relaxation of your mind.

4.	Reward yourself after a solid study-period or after completing an assignment. Take a good snack, drink juice, check your messages or indulge in quick games, stroll in the garden or just have a leisurely talk. 

5.	A good night’s sleep and even an afternoon powernap sharpens focus and improves working memory. Hence, never underestimate the significance of sleep.

10.	Revision and practice are the keys to long-term memory.
6.	Take notes clear your doubts during class lectures. It is much easier to read your own notes than to read the entire textbook, when the exam time rolls.
7.	Burning the midnight oil (cramming) the night before a test isn’t productive. It’s better to get a good night’s sleep.
11.	Don’t let a bad grade keep you down. Failures could be your pillars of success only if you don’t lose courage.
8.	Redefine success. It is not only about your marks. 
9.	By making success about your hard-work or effort rather than results, you will feel good. Emphasising score-sheets increases pressure and can lead to poor outcomes. Emphasising effort reduces pressure, promotes more effort, and ultimately may bring about better results!
10.	By setting a goal and creating a pathway to obtain that goal, you are far more likely to perform well. Goal setting is one of the most powerful ways to obtain positive outcomes in any area of life, including school.
11.	Make a study group or at least make a few friends who you can contact from your class if you have a homework question or had to miss class (and do the same for them!).  

12.	Regular physical exercise, yoga or meditation are keys to maintain physical and mental agility.
